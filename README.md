# passport-nft

[Passport](https://passportjs.org/) strategy for authenticating with an NFT and nonce.

This module lets you authenticate using an on-chain (defaults to Web3/EVM combo)
NFT and an off-chain database. By using Passport, it's a very simple process for
anyone to integrate their own NFT authentication strategy. This module follows
[Connect](https://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)-styled middleware, and can be used
with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) or [Koa.js](https://koajs.com/).
